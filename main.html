    <font size="5"><p style="width:500;height:200;">Local Furry Con was made on the 10th February of 2022 with the name FurrParty. The server was made very simple with very little moderation and no verification and low activity. It was later renamed to The Local Furries which introduced the Verification, better moderation, better Rules, more staff, Partnerships, Giveaways, Events and much more. For the 3rd rename, it was renamed to Local Furry Con which will be the name that will be used forever, with this rename some more stuff were introduced, such as auto moderation, which automaticly prevents raids, banned words, spam, all caps, staff applications were also introduced for the first time.</p></font>
